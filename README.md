# Password Manager
My enhanced version of the password manager app from the excellent Udemy 100 days of code python course. 

My changes
1. created a class for the app
2. Store the data in a csv file and use Pandas 
3. Add a drop down to search for existing websites. Password is automatically copied to clipboard once you select a website
4. Add inputs for fields related to working with APIs: Token, App ID. This may come in handy for websites that have an API.
5. Add checkbox to indicate if two factor authentication is used for the website
6. Add a text control for notes
7. Add copy buttons for the Token and App ID fields
